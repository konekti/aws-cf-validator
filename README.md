# AWS CloudFormation YAML Validator

This repo contains the source code for my first app that uses AWS's Python Serverless Microframework, [chalice](https://github.com/aws/chalice). The app is live at https://konekti.us/aws-cf-validator/.

chalice does not have a defined mechanism for distributing code. I've listed the steps you can follow to launch the app.

1. Install python 3.6 on your machine. My OS is Ubuntu 16.04. I used the J Fernyhoughâ€™s Personal Package Archive (PPA) as described in this blog [post](https://www.rosehosting.com/blog/how-to-install-python-3-6-on-ubuntu-16-04/)
2. Execute `aws configure` to create an .aws/config file or create one manually. You can skip this step if you've already configured the machine for the AWS CLI or boto3.
3. Use pip, pipenv or other python packaging tool to install the chalice and boto3 modules (e.g., `pip install chalice boto3`).
4. Execute the commands in the text below.
```
chalice new-project my-chalice-project
cd my-chalice-project
rm app.py
wget https://raw.githubusercontent.com/konekti/chalice/master/LICENSE
chalice deploy
```
5. Note the REST API URL that `chalice deploy` prints. Add the string "validate" to the end. The URL for testing should resemble "https://3d7dikellka.execute-api.us-east-1.amazonaws.com/api/validate/". I set the environment variable CFURL to prevent repetitive typing.
6. Download a valid CloudFormation templates such as this [one](https://konekti.us/assets/posts/2018/vpc.yaml).
7. Send a POST request using the data from the template. `curl -H "Content-Type: text/plain" --data-binary @vpc.yaml $CFURL. The response should be "{"validity": "true", "message": "valid"}".

In the case you get stuck, read the chalice README.
